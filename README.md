## Welcome to AI in Architecture

In our conceptual framework, we address architecture through the lens of artificial intelligence (AI). While the former is a domain, the latter is a method. To approach the field, we distinguish between the scientific methods of “analysis” and “synthesis,” which allows us to understand “appearance” and “organization” in architecture. We focus on visual architectural data, such as floor plans, sections, elevations, maps, diagrams, and graphs, which can be analyzed or synthesized by a combination of tools and techniques. Tools are items that serve a defined purpose, while techniques are the systematic procedures that involve knowledge exchange and performance between various actors. We perceive architecture as a relation between appearance and organization. By appearance, we consider architectural forms, aesthetics, epochs, design intuitions, and cultural parameters. By organization, we mean building typologies, taxonomies, climate, and comfort. This does not disqualify other methods but adds an encompassing understanding of architectural design through the use of AI.
